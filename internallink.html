<p>In a world of data space where organizations deal with petabytes and exabytes of data, the era of Big Data emerged, and the essence of its storage also grew. It was a great challenge and concern for industries for the storage of data until 2010. Now when frameworks like Hadoop and others solved the problem of storage, the focus shifted to the processing of data. Data Science plays a big role here. All those fancy Sci-fi movies you love to watch around can be turned into reality by Data Science.

<p>Data Science Lifecycle revolves around the use of machine learning and different analytical strategies to produce insights and predictions from information in order to acquire a commercial enterprise objective. The complete method includes a number of steps like data cleaning, preparation, modelling, model evaluation, etc. It is a lengthy procedure and may additionally take quite a few months to complete. So, it is very essential to have a generic structure to observe for each and every hassle at hand. The globally mentioned structure in fixing any analytical problem is referred to as a Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining or CRISP-DM framework.
