<p>In a world of data space where organizations deal with petabytes and exabytes of data, the era of Big Data emerged, and the essence of its storage also grew. It was a great challenge and concern for industries for the storage of data until 2010. Now when frameworks like Hadoop and others solved the problem of storage, the focus shifted to the processing of data. Data Science plays a big role here. All those fancy Sci-fi movies you love to watch around can be turned into reality by Data Science. Nowadays its growth has been increased in multiple ways and thus one should be ready for our future by learning what it is and how can we add value to it.Data science is the practice of mining large data sets of raw data, both structured and unstructured, to identify patterns and extract actionable insight from them. This is an interdisciplinary field, and the foundations of data science include statistics, inference, computer science, predictive analytics, machine learning algorithm development, and new technologies to gain insights from big data.

To define data science and improve data science project management, start with its life cycle. The first stage in the data science pipeline workflow involves capture: acquiring data, sometimes extracting it, and entering it into the system. The next stage is maintenance, which includes data warehousing, data cleansing, data processing, data staging, and data architecture.

<a name="Lifecycle">The Data Science Lifecycle </a>
<p>Data Science Lifecycle revolves around the use of machine learning and different analytical strategies to produce insights and predictions from information in order to acquire a commercial enterprise objective. The complete method includes a number of steps like data cleaning, preparation, modelling, model evaluation, etc. It is a lengthy procedure and may additionally take quite a few months to complete. So, it is very essential to have a generic structure to observe for each and every hassle at hand. The globally mentioned structure in fixing any analytical problem is referred to as a Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining or CRISP-DM framework.The data science life cycle is simply the series of steps a data scientist—or another related professional—takes to complete the process of solving a problem for an organisation using large amounts of data and various other tools. Everyone's data science life cycle may look slightly different, but they all include the same six basic steps. Those steps are sometimes broken down or combined, so more or fewer steps are listed in the cycle. Even so, every data science life cycle starts with identifying a problem and ends with communicating the data models created to the appropriate colleagues and business leaders.

<a name="Data Scientist">What is Data Scientist</a>
<p>Data scientists determine the questions their team should be asking and figure out how to answer those questions using data. They often develop predictive models for theorizing and forecasting.Data scientists are often expected to form their own questions about the data, while data analysts might support teams that already have set goals in mind. A data scientist might also spend more time developing models, using machine learning, or incorporating advanced programming to find and analyze data.A data scientist is an analytics professional who is responsible for collecting, analyzing and interpreting data to help drive decision-making in an organization. The data scientist role combines elements of several traditional and technical jobs, including mathematician, scientist, statistician and computer programmer. It involves the use of advanced analytics techniques, such as machine learning and predictive modeling, along with the application of scientific principles.

As part of data science initiatives, data scientists often must work with large amounts of data to develop and test hypotheses, make inferences and analyze things such as customer and market trends, financial risks, cybersecurity threats, stock trades, equipment maintenance needs and medical conditions.

In businesses, data scientists typically mine data for information that can be used to predict customer behavior, identify new revenue opportunities, detect fraudulent transactions and meet other business needs. They also do valuable analytics work for healthcare providers, academic institutions, government agencies, sports teams and other types of organizations.

Data scientist was first used as a job title in 2008, simultaneously at Facebook and LinkedIn; four years later, a Harvard Business Review article famously called it "the sexiest job of the 21st century." The demand for data science skills has grown significantly over the years, as companies look to glean useful information from increasing volumes of big data and take advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies to enable new types of analytics applications.
